# Online-Buy-and-Sell-Marketplace-Project
The system being designed will act as a marketplace for second hand items that are used by college students. On this platform, both the supplier and the customer will be from the same category of users, i.e. college students. Even in contemporary times, when a college student does not require an item that he has used in his college life, he tries to sell it to another student or scrap dealers in the offline world. These transactions are highly inefficient as most of the times the college student is not able to find a potential customer in the offline world. The online platform that is being built in this project will have a steady flow of both suppliers and users. The Online Buy and Sell Marketplace is designed and developed to automate all manual buying and selling second hand items operations. That means a one stop destination which provides the facility to the users to buy and sell the second-hand items without any complexity.

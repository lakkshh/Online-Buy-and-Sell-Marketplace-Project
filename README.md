# Online Buy and Sell Marketplace Project *(TIET MARKETPLACE)*

The system being designed will act as a marketplace for second hand items that are used by college students. On this platform, both the supplier and the customer will be from the same category of users, i.e. college students. Even in contemporary times, when a college student does not require an item that he has used in his college life, he tries to sell it to another student or scrap dealers in the offline world. These transactions are highly inefficient as most of the times the college student is not able to find a potential customer in the offline world. The online platform that is being built in this project will have a steady flow of both suppliers and users. The Online Buy and Sell Marketplace is designed and developed to automate all manual buying and selling second hand items operations. That means a one stop destination which provides the facility to the users to buy and sell the second-hand items without any complexity.

The portal is implemented in the form of a website as well as an Android mobile application where the users can buy and sell their respective items. The system uses numerous technologies like HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Bootstrap, SQL amongst others to bring the whole project together.
HTML provides the basic framework for the pages. CSS is used for styling and designing the pages. JavaScript, JQuery. Bootstrap is mainly needed to make the website responsive. PHP and SQL allow database connectivity.

The functionalities include:
- The user can list their second-hand items for sale
- The user can buy the listed second-hand items
- The user can view the listed second-hand items
